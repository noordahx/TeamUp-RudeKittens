### üßò Problem we want to solve:

The World Health Organization (WHO) states that **physical inactivity** is a leading risk factor for non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer (WHO, 2019). So, staying active is important. However, **doing sports keeps growing inconvenient**, especially because... 

**Finding teammates is a getting harder!**. Engaging in sports alone is correlated with less accountability, making it difficult for people to stick to a fitness routine due to a lack of social support.

By providing a platform to help people find workout partners and participate in team sports, we want to address one of these barriers and make it easier for people to stay active.

### ‚õπÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Our Solution:

**Providing a platform to help people find workout partners and participate in team sportsüèê** can provide:
- social support and accountability,
- build a sense of community around fitness, 
- make it more enjoyable and easier to stick to a fitness routine. 

Regular physical activity will help with mental, physical health and reduce risks of many diseases.

### üßóüèª How it Works: 

1. To reduce risks, people will register with their HKID. 
2. Users will create profiles with preferred locations for workouts, interests, fitness goals, and experience level, which is important for matching buddies. 3. They will be able to create events by specifying the details, such as the date and time, location, type of workout, skill level required, and number of participants.
4. They will be able to browse and join existing events.
5. After working out, users can rate each other based on various criteria, such as punctuality, skill level, and overall experience. This can help build trust among users and encourage better behavior. 
6. Moreover, users should have the ability to communicate with each other before and after events, such as to coordinate logistics or share feedback.
